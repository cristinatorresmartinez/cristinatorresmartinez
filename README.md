I am a Software Developer based in the Austin, TX area I am proficient in both Frontend development and Backend development. I have extensive knowledge in vanilla Javascript, and MERN. I aspire to help bring creative projects to life and demonstrate my commitment to developing world-class software solutions for your company.

I come from a small town in Mexico. I immigrated to Arlington, TX, and then my family settled in Deep East Texas in a small town called Waskom, TX. I graduated high school and attended Texas A&M University. Working in the health field for about 4 years now I want to pursue my passion in coding. I found Leon through Reddit and became an avid follower of his on Twitch and Twitter.
